# Tutorial Code
## You can find the video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/thedotisblack/videos)
The original code is based on [thedotisBlack.com](thedotisBlack.com), where I do sligh perosnal modifications that make them more interesting (at least from my perspective).

# proc
Gradle based project for Processing.org sketches. 
See First.java for example usage.
1. Create class that extends PApplet
2. Create settings and draw methods
3. Create static main method that uses PApplet.main(); and set the class name(full path) that has settings and draw methods.
